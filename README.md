# Bebo-Legacy-System
## Overview
This project is a social media platform inspired by the Bebo social system. It allows users to create accounts, upload posts containing images and text, and interact with other users' content. The platform incorporates two essential features: image analysis for safe search and sentiment analysis for text.

## Features
The social media platform includes the following components:

### User Management
- User Registration: Users can create new accounts by providing necessary details such as username, email, and password.
- User Authentication: Secure user authentication is implemented to ensure that only registered users can access the platform's features.
- User Profiles: Users can customize their profiles by adding profile pictures, bios, and other relevant information.

### Post Creation and Interaction
- Post Upload: Users can create posts by uploading images along with descriptive text.
- Post Feed: A personalized feed displays posts from users the logged-in user follows, allowing for easy content discovery.
- Post Interactions: Users can like posts, enabling social interactions within the platform.

### Image Analysis
- Safe Search Analysis: Uploaded images are analyzed for safe search to detect potentially unsafe content such as adult content, violence, and explicit material.


### Sentiment Analysis
- Text Sentiment Analysis: The text accompanying each post is analyzed for sentiment to determine the sentiment expressed in the text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.
